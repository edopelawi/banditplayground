# banditplayground

A simple project to simulate [Andy Stanton's TDD suite for C++](http://andy.stanton.is/writing/about/unit-testing-and-mocking-in-c/), and learning how to do TDD in C++ properly.

This project name was taken from the main TDD framework that used on it, which is [banditcpp](http://banditcpp.org/index.html). Quite good bridge for those who already spoiled with rspec-like syntax for starting on C++.
